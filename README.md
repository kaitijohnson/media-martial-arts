They say, "The book is always better," but is it really? The Media Martial Arts - Ultimate Fight Club app settles that question once and for all by comparing the average user rating of a book versus its film adaptation to determine which is better.

Type a title into the search bar, select the book and movie you want to compare from the search results, then click the "FIGHT!" button to declare the champion. The app isn't limited to movies. It can also compare the book to any film adaptation, such as a TV show or mini-series.

This app was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS with Materialize and JQuery frameworks. It pulls media data from the Goodreads and OMDB APIs.
